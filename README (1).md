# prophet-challenge


This is a Module 8 challenge for the AI Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill. This assignment analyzes Mercado Libre's financial and user data to identify growth opportunities for the company. The goal is to determine if predicting search traffic can lead to successful stock trading. The project identifies unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic, analyzes seasonality in the search data, correlates search traffic with stock price patterns, and creates a time series model using Prophet.
